    "3. Show the VSWR curve and check if the point of lowest VSWR corresponds to 868MHz.  If not, you might have to lengthen or shorten the antenna.  The actual impedance is very dependent on the location of your finger/hand, but that doesn't influence the frequency of lowest VSWR much, only the value of the lowest VSWR.  It's really important that the measurement is done with the PCB in the user's hand.  Covering the antenna by fingers has a huge influence on the impedance."
