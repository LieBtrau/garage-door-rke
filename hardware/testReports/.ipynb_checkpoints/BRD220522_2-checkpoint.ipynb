    " * USB-CDC is only an alternative during debugging.  USB-CDC requires a USB-data connection and the virtual COM-port must be open on the PC-end.\n",

    "* **Problem** : High disturbance on 3V3 when sending data and when 3V3 is supplied by ESProg.\n",
    "* **Fix** : \n",
    " * It would be better that the ESProg injects power on 5V instead of on 3V3. As such, the 3V3 doesn't need to \"leave\" the device and is less prone to injection of spurious signals.  This injection could be done with diode OR-ing of the USB-power input.  \n",
    " * Smaller, 1A diodes could be used (e.g. LCSC C8598) instead of the large 2A diode in use now.\n",
    " * Add BAT54C.  Anode1 connected to VUSB, anode2 connected to CN2.2, cathode connected to Q1.1.\n",
    " * Add 1A schottky from CN2.2 to VCC."

The actual impedance is very dependent on the location of your finger/hand, but that doesn't influence the frequency of lowest VSWR much, only the value of the lowest VSWR.  It's really important that the measurement is done with the PCB in the user's hand.  Covering the antenna by fingers has a huge influence on the impedance."
